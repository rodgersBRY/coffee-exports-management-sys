# Procurement Module

## Purpose
- Supports auction lot capture and direct sourcing workflows.

## Files
- `config.ts`: field config for direct agreements and JSON templates for auction lots/direct deliveries.

## Notes
- Auction lots are created via action form and mapped to immutable backend behavior.
- Direct agreements use paginated list + create panel.
